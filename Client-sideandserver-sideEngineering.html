            <h2>Where code runs</h2>
            <p>
                Client-side and server-side development differ greatly in where code runs. Client-side development involves running code on the client's or user's device. Server-side development involves running code through a server.

            <p>
                Client-side versus server-side development differs in the way scripts run. Client-side scripting involves running scripts on a device. Client-side scripts typically run in a browser. A web server runs server-side scripts. Client-Side Scripting vs. Server-Side Scripting: What's the Difference?

               Client-side development is usually user-centric, while server-side development occurs behind the scenes. Web developers focus on creating the parts of a website or application that users can see, such as visual design elements and webpage layouts.

            <p>
                A server-side developer focuses on more hidden components, such as how an application transmits data to the server. Server-side code is often invisible to users, while client-side code is visible to them.

       <section id="Purpose">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
    The purposes of client-side and server-side development are also different. Client-side development creates visual effects and elements for websites, including layouts and user interfaces. A server-side application focuses on the actual content of a webpage, interacting with databases and retrieving information from a server.

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                There are also different levels of security for client-side and server-side programs. Users are often able to see and interact with client-side programs, which makes them less secure. Since users cannot access or interact with server-side source code, server-side programs often have higher levels of security than client-side programs.
