                The World Wide Web (WWW), also known as the Web, is a system of interconnected documents that are accessible through the Internet.
                It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.
                The WWW has become an integral part of modern life, serving various purposes such as communication, commerce, education, and entertainment.

            <h2>How does the Web work?</h2>
            <p>
                The Web consists of a vast network of computers known as web servers.
                These servers store web pages, which are documents written in HTML.
                HTML is a markup language using tags to define a web page's structure and appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a user visits a web page, their computer sends a request to the web server storing the page.
                The web server then sends the page to the user's computer, where it's displayed in a web browser.

            <h2>Differences between WWW and the Internet</h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet are commonly mistaken, yet they are distinct.
                The WWW is a service operating on top of the Internet, enabling users to access and interact with information stored on web servers.
                In contrast, the Internet is the foundational network that enables the functionality of the WWW.
